      <p> Mammals are a highly successful and diverse class of vertebrate animals that inhabit nearly every environment on Earth, from oceans to polar ice caps and dense forests. Key defining characteristics that set them apart from other animals are the presence of hair or fur, warm-bloodedness (endothermy), and the ability of females to produce milk for their young via specialized mammary glands. These physiological traits, along with a complex brain and a four-chambered heart, enable mammals to maintain a constant internal body temperature and lead active lifestyles in varied climates. The class Mammalia includes over 6,600 species, ranging in size from the tiny bumblebee bat to the massive blue whale, the largest animal to have ever lived. Mammels are seen in many different ways, such as big cats to small animals.</p>
