    <p> Reptiles are one of the many fascinating creatures out there, they are some who have many different features.
        Reptiles are a diverse class of cold-blooded vertebrates that possess scales or scutes and typically lay amniotic eggs on land. This group includes well-known animals such as crocodiles, snakes, lizards, turtles, and tortoises.
         Reptiles vary greatly in size, habitat, and diet, encompassing everything from the massive saltwater crocodile to small geckos, playing essential roles as both predators and prey in ecosystems worldwide.Reptiles primarily reproduce through internal fertilization, a key adaptation that allowed them to become fully terrestrial.
